# CTI-modules

In building this project, I'm looking to answer the question:
### How can we turn threat intelligence into a repeatable, highly automated operational capability that could materially improve detection, response, and risk decisions for any organization; 
### Module by module.

## Problems to tackle:
1. Massive amount of feeds (finding relevance, insights)
2. Massive amount of logs (finding threats, IOCs)
3. Insufficient coverage and context (lack of breadth and depth) --> results in higher MTTD/MTTR
4. Threat-driven vs data-driven
5. End-to-end integration + feedback to CTI
6. Automate (reliably)
7. Make everything simple.
